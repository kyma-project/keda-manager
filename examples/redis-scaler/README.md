## Scenario

This example realizes the scaling of jobs based on the size of [list](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/lists/) in Redis.
When scheduled, each job pops a message from the list and stops.
Additionally, there is a function that awaits  HTTP traffic and populates messages to the Redis list.

## Prerequisites

 - `KUBECONFIG` env variable pointing to a Kubernetes instance
 - Helm client installed locally on your machine
 - The Keda and Serverless modules added in the Kyma cluster (`make ensure_kyma_modules`)


## Deploy 

1. Deploy Redis

Install Redis in the `redis` namespace.

   ```sh
   kubectl create ns redis
   helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
   helm repo update
   helm install my-release bitnami/redis --namespace redis
   ```

2. Deploy the example

Run the following make target to deploy the application:

   ```sh
   make deploy_app
   ```

   ```sh
   scaledjob.keda.sh/processor-scaled-job created
   function.serverless.kyma-project.io/emitter-fn created
   ```

3. Verify

Observe Pods in the `redis` namespace. There is one Function pod and Redis itself.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n redis -w
   NAME                                READY   STATUS        RESTARTS        AGE
   my-release-redis-master-0           1/1     Running       0               9h
   my-release-redis-replicas-1         1/1     Running       0               9h
   my-release-redis-replicas-2         1/1     Running       5 (6h50m ago)   21h
   my-release-redis-replicas-0         1/1     Running       5 (6h50m ago)   21h
   emitter-fn-build-j46wc-6sx6v        0/1     Completed     0               14m
   emitter-fn-nkzkg-78cd47cd78-lxbms   1/1     Running       1 (13m ago)     14m
   ```

Expose the emitter Function using port-forward and send a few messages to populate the Redis list.

   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward -n redis svc/emitter-fn  8080:80
   ```

Send a few messages using the POST request to `emitter-fn`

   ```sh
   curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"msg":"hello1"}' localhost:8080
   curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"msg":"hello2"}' localhost:8080
   curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"msg":"hello3"}' localhost:8080
   ```

Keda should spin scaled jobs as a result of new messages in the Redis list. They will do their job and enter the ' Completed` state.

   ```sh
   kubecttl get pods -n redis -w 
   NAME                                READY   STATUS        RESTARTS      AGE
   my-release-redis-master-0           1/1     Running       0             10h
   my-release-redis-replicas-1         1/1     Running       0             10h
   my-release-redis-replicas-2         1/1     Running       5 (7h ago)    21h
   my-release-redis-replicas-0         1/1     Running       5 (7h ago)    21h
   emitter-fn-nkzkg-78cd47cd78-lxbms   1/1     Running       1 (23m ago)   24m

   processor-scaled-job-n68tp-x2p64    0/1     Completed           0             3s
   processor-scaled-job-vn4lg-g694x    0/1     Completed           0             3s
   processor-scaled-job-vn4lg-g694x    0/1     Completed           0             5s
   processor-scaled-job-n68tp-x2p64    0/1     Completed           0             5s
   processor-scaled-job-vn4lg-g694x    0/1     Completed           0             6s
   processor-scaled-job-n68tp-x2p64    0/1     Completed           0             6s
   ```

When you inspect the jobs logs, you should see that all messages have been processed.
   ```sh
   kubectl logs -n redis -l scaledjob.keda.sh/name=processor-scaled-job -f
   Processing started for hello2.. will finish in 8283ms
   Processing started for hello3.. will finish in 1523ms
   Processing started for hello1.. will finish in 8969ms
   ```
