# Keda module

## What is KEDA

Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler [(KEDA)](https://keda.sh/) is an autoscaler that allows you to easily scale your Kubernetes-based resources. You can scale your applications on the basis of the data of your choice.

Keda supports a great number of scalers that help you manage your deployments. For the complete list, check the KEDA [Scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) documentation.

For more information about KEDA features, see [KEDA documentation](https://keda.sh/docs).

## Keda module

Keda module is an extension to Kyma that allows you to install and manage KEDA on your Kubernetes cluster, using Keda Manager.

## Keda Manager

Keda Manager helps you to install and manage KEDA on your cluster. It manages the lifecycle of KEDA based on the dedicated Keda custom resource (CR).
